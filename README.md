# Design-of-Tunable-Microwave-Photon-Filter
Design of Tunable Microwave Photon Filter this is my Undergraduate Design

The text discusses research on tunable microwave photonic filters (MPFs), explaining the basic principles, main parameters, and classifications. It addresses the issue of shape changes in the frequency response curve of MPFs with positive and negative coefficients during tuning, proposing a complex coefficient microwave photonic filter and trap filter that introduces additional phase using FD-OP to solve this problem. The study includes simulation and analysis of several filters using MATLAB software, finding that complex coefficient MPFs can maintain a good frequency response curve shape while tuning. It is also noted that a complex coefficient microwave photonic trap filter can be achieved when the tap coefficients meet certain function distribution conditions. Additionally, the flatness of a 50-tap complex coefficient microwave photonic trap filter is better than that of 2, 4, and 8-tap filters, while maintaining the frequency response curve unchanged during tuning.
